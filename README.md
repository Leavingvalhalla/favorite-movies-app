# Movie Database

Movie Database is a small web app that allows you to keep track of all the movies you've seen, and give them a rating.
There's a page to add new movies, and a page that lists all your logged films.
You can easily edit your rating of a film by clicking the "Edit Rating" button.

You will need to create a db.json file in the parent folder of this app and run a json server to be able to use the app properly (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server#getting-started).

This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with a small amount of styling from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
